<h1>The best movies according to Paul</h1>
<h2>My 3 favourite movies of all time...</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it reminds me of my childhood. A great childhood...
</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it portrays some objective and cold facts about the physical nature of reality,
    but at the same time conveying an immense level of emotional depth...
</p>
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>Also a great movie from my middle childhood. It has great visuals, a great story and message, a very
    evocative soundtrack. I love it. I've watched it like 10 times already since it went out in 2009...
